# Collector Chain - Tokenized collectible - MVP Alyra 2022 / Developer class Rynkeby

## Project presentation
### Overview
Collector Chain is a collectibles tokenization platform : https://collector-chain-tokenized-collectibles.vercel.app/

<img src="./imageReadme.png" alt="drawing" width="500"/>

By submitting a request to a DAO of enthusiasts, each user will be able to tokenize a unique physical object that they own (numbered or collectible).

Once the request has been accepted and valued by the DAO, two types of NFT from the object can be created :
- A "owership certificate" NFT, split into 100 and allowing the purchase/sale of the real ownership of the object. The owner must transmit the object to collector chain to be able to mint the NFTs

- A unique 'digital object' NFT that can be sold, worn or rented for use in the web3 world
